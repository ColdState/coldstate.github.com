<a href="http://distractionware.com/games/flash/dontlookback">Don't Look Back</a> is an indie game by Terry Cavanagh based on the Orpheus and Euridice story. There's a lot of platforming, to rapidly get a sense of the whole game you might watch a playthrough <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsI1z2u8jiA">video</a>.

<a href="http://wanderlands.org/main/midas">Midas</a> is a entry in the LD48 #22 ("alone") Jam that uses some of these techniques.
</p>
<p>
These are a few scraps regarding storytelling:
<ul>
<li>MZB sez "A likable character overcomes almost insuperable odds and by his or her own efforts achieves a worthwhile goal."</li>
<li>Imitating the structure of the <a href="fortunately.html">fortunately/unfortunately</a> joke is reasonable. You can connect <a href="flow1.svg">Flow</a> to <a href="flow2.svg">fortunately...</a>.</li>
<li>True forking plots are exponential amounts of work. <a href="http://nickm.com/if/emshort/galatea.html">Galatea</a> is an example.</li>
<li>Mostly, instead of actually forking, the plot offers a choice where both choices lead to the same outcome. (Magician's Choice)</li>
<li>Often, instead of forking-and-rejoining with progress on both sides,
one of the forks is actually a failure/loopback path. It does lead to the same outcome, because the player can recover/restart.</li>
<li>Artistic content (backdrop paintings, cutscenes, voiceovers) is very expensive to create. Games dole out artistic content, gated with obstacles.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
These are a few techniques for conserving art:
<ul>
<li>Limited palette</li>
<li>Limited size in pixels</li>
<li>Limited lighting or window size</li>
<li>Symbolic rather than representational depiction</li>
<li>Consistent stylized aesthetic</li>
<li>Use text</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
This is a few scraps regarding canvas/svg/cairo
intended to be used the way Julia Child
used to turn around and take out something already-prepared.
</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Step 1, in <a href="julia_child_1.html">html</a>, <a href="julia_child_1.svg">svg</a>, <a href="julia_child_1.txt">C</a> and <a href="julia_child_1.py">python</a>.</li>
<li>Step 2, in <a href="julia_child_2.html">html</a>, <a href="julia_child_2.svg">svg</a>, <a href="julia_child_2.txt">C</a> and <a href="julia_child_2.py">python</a>.</li>
<li>Step 3, in <a href="julia_child_3.html">html</a>, <a href="julia_child_3.svg">svg</a>, <a href="julia_child_3.txt">C</a> and <a href="julia_child_3.py">python</a>.</li>
<li>Step 4 in <a href="julia_child_4.html">html</a>.</li>
</ul>
