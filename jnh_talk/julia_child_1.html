2d vector graphcs libraries, specifications, and interfaces
are not actually particularly different from one another.
They all pay attention to one another,
and they all draw from the same sources,
and they are often implemented using the same underlying libraries
or techniques.
</p>
<p>
In vector graphics, the basic way to draw a thing is
to build a path representing a shape,
and then either stroke a brush along the sides of the shape,
or fill the interior of the shape with paint.
